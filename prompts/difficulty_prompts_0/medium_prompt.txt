Create a MEDIUM difficulty multiple choice question that tests the following BCBA learning objective:

Domain: {domain}
Learning Objective {subdomain}: {learning_objective}

Requirements for Medium Questions:
1. Require application or analysis of the learning objective, rather than simple recall.
2. Integrate 2-3 related principles to increase complexity.
3. Include a realistic scenario that requires multi-step problem solving.
4. Have exactly 4 answer choices (A, B, C, D) where:
- The correct answer is clearly supported by behavioral principles.
- The distractors reflect common misconceptions or partial misunderstandings.

Format your response exactly like this:
Q: [Your question here]
A: [First option]
B: [Second option]
C: [Third option]
D: [Fourth option]
Correct: [A, B, C, or D]
Rationale: [Your detailed explanation that connects to the learning objective]
