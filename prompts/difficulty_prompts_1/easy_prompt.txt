Create an EASY multiple choice question that tests the following BCBA learning objective:

Domain: {domain}
Learning Objective {subdomain}: {learning_objective}

Requirements for Easy Questions:
1. Focus on basic understanding of the learning objective.
2. Use clear, straightforward language.
3. Test direct recall or simple application (Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy: "Remember" or "Understand").
4. Provide exactly 4 options
5. Distractors should be plausible but clearly incorrect to someone with basic knowledge.
6. The correct answer should be unambiguous based on BCBA principles.

Parse the multiple choice questions into the following JSON format:
{{
  "question": "str",  
  "options": ["str", "str", "str", "str"],  
  "correct_answer": int,  # Index (0-3) of the correct answer  
  "rationale": "str",  # Brief explanation of why the correct answer is right  
  "bloom_taxonomy": "str"  # One of: ["Remember", "Understand", "Apply", "Analyze", "Evaluate", "Create"]  
}}

Example Output:
