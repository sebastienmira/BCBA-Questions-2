### Explicit Rating System
Each criterion should be rated from 1 to 5, following these definitions: 

- 1 - Unacceptable: Severe flaws, major errors, or misleading information. Needs a complete rewrite.  
- 2 - Weak: Significant issues, but partially usable with major revisions.

- 4 - Good (Minor Refinements Needed): Mostly strong, but small areas could be improved.  
- 5 - Excellent: No changes needed, meets BCBA certification standards.

- overall_quality: How strong is the question overall? Are there reduncies between question and answers?
- topic_alignment: Does the question accurately assess knowledge within the given domain/subdomain?  
- answer_correctness: Is the correct answer truly the best choice?  
- difficulty_appropriateness: Is the question well-calibrated to its difficulty level and Bloom's taxonomy?  
- question_clarity: Is the wording clear, precise, and unambiguous?  
- distractor_quality: Are the incorrect answers plausible but ultimately incorrect? The distractors shouldn't be obvious. 
- explanation_quality: Is the rationale thorough, logically sound, and informative?  
- is_acceptable: (true/false) â†’ False if issues exist, such as redundancy, vague wording, or misleading information.
