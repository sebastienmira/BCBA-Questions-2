    "question": "A BCBA is supervising a team of therapists working with children with autism. During a performance review, one therapist consistently demonstrates difficulty in implementing behavior intervention plans (BIPs) effectively. The BCBA decides to conduct a performance diagnostic to identify the underlying issues. After observing the therapist's sessions, the BCBA notes that the therapist often fails to reinforce desired behaviors consistently and misidentifies the function of challenging behaviors. Which of the following actions should the BCBA prioritize to address the therapist's performance issues while ensuring that the intervention is grounded in behaviorism and the principles of applied behavior analysis?",

    "question": "A BCBA is consulting at a school and observes a student, Liam, who frequently engages in off-task behaviors (e.g., staring out the window, doodling) during independent math assignments. The BCBA hypothesizes that Liam's off-task behaviors are maintained by automatic reinforcement, as they occur consistently regardless of teacher attention or peer interactions. To accurately measure Liam's off-task behavior, the BCBA designs a discontinuous measurement procedure. She selects momentary time sampling with 1-minute intervals during 20-minute math sessions. After two weeks, the data indicate that Liam is off-task during approximately 65% of sampled intervals. Liam's teacher argues that the data underestimate the true occurrence of off-task behaviors because Liam often returns to task briefly when the timer beeps. Considering radical behaviorism and measurement principles, how should the BCBA respond to the teacher's concern?",
    "options": [
      "Agree with the teacher and switch to partial interval recording, as it captures any occurrence of off-task behavior within intervals, aligning better with radical behaviorism's emphasis on observable events.",

The teacher's concern that Liam briefly returns to task at the beep is valid, as momentary time sampling may underestimate behaviors that are brief or intermittent. However, radical behaviorism emphasizes observable and measurable events rather than internal states or inferred processes. Therefore, the BCBA should acknowledge the teacher's concern and suggest adjusting the interval length (e.g., shortening intervals) to increase accuracy. Option A (partial interval recording) would overestimate behavior occurrence, not providing an accurate representation. Option C incorrectly claims radical behaviorism prioritizes internal states, which it explicitly does not.

Parsimony is a fundamental philosophical assumption in behavior analysis, emphasizing the necessity to rule out simpler explanations or interventions before adopting more complex ones. By choosing an overly complicated intervention based solely on intuition and anecdotal experience, the BCBA disregarded this principle. Additionally, ethical standards mandate that behavior analysts maintain competence by continually engaging in professional development activities and adhering to evidence-based practices. Failing to prioritize simpler, empirically supported interventions first violates both the philosophical assumption of parsimony and the ethical requirement to maintain professional competence through evidence-based decision-making. Options A, B, and D contain sophisticated misconceptions: determinism (A) involves the lawful and causal nature of behavior, pragmatism (B) emphasizes practical outcomes, and selectionism (D) pertains to the evolutionary selection of behavior based on consequences.

The BCBA has implemented a behavior intervention plan (BIP) that successfully reduced aggression by teaching Alex alternative communication skills. However, the BCBA is concerned about potential relapse due to upcoming changes in Alex's environment, including a move to a new school with a different cultural demographic. To address these concerns, the BCBA decides to conduct a thorough assessment that includes cultural variables and plans for relapse prevention. Which of the following strategies best integrates the assessment of cultural variables and the planning for relapse prevention?",

Leila's BCBA and her parents decide to deny Leila access to her phone until the summertime.

    "correct_answer": 1,
    "rationale": "Correct Answer Explanation: Leila's tantrums increased due to an extinction burst. An extinction burst is a temporary increase in the frequency or intensity of the behavior when the reinforcement that previously maintained the behavior is no longer provided. Leila's increase in tantrums is a common response when access to a previously available reinforcer (her phone) is suddenly denied. Incorrect Answers: A. The procedure is not effective, and another strategy should be tried. The increase in tantrums is expected during an extinction burst and does not necessarily indicate that the procedure is ineffective. C. Leila's behavior is getting worse because she is now seeking attention in other ways. While she might seek attention in other ways, the primary reason for the initial increase is likely due to the extinction burst. D. The procedure is too restrictive and the phone should be limited after 9 P.M. instead of throughout the school year. While this could be a consideration, the immediate increase in tantrums is best explained by the extinction burst rather than the restrictiveness of the procedure.",

    "question": "A BCBA is supervising a team of RBTs who are tasked with implementing a behavior intervention plan (BIP) for a child with autism. The BCBA notices that the RBTs are inconsistently recording data on the frequency of the child's target behaviors and are relying heavily on anecdotal reports from parents to assess progress. To improve the data collection and ensure a more accurate evaluation of the child's behavior, the BCBA decides to implement a new measurement system. Which of the following actions would best exemplify a function-based approach for assessing and improving the RBTs' behavior while also ensuring the use of appropriate measurement methods?",
    "options": [
      "The BCBA conducts a training session solely focused on the importance of anecdotal data and encourages the RBTs to prioritize parent reports over direct observation.",
      "The BCBA implements a structured data collection protocol that includes both direct measures (e.g., frequency counts during sessions) and indirect measures (e.g., parent surveys) and monitors the RBTs' adherence to this protocol through regular performance feedback.",
      "The BCBA decides to replace the BIP with a new intervention based on the RBTs' feedback about the current data collection methods without assessing the effectiveness of the previous intervention.",

This aligns with the learning objectives by distinguishing between measurement types and applying performance diagnostics to improve supervisee behavior. Option A misguides the RBTs by emphasizing anecdotal data, which is less reliable. Option C fails to address the importance of data collection and does not utilize a systematic approach to improve the current intervention. Option D oversimplifies the data collection process, potentially leading to incomplete and inaccurate assessments of the child's behavior.",

    "correct_answer": 1,
    "rationale": "The correct answer is B because the BCBA must make data-based decisions (H7) regarding intervention effectiveness. Although calling-out has decreased slightly, the emergence of excessive hand-raising indicates an unwanted side effect (H4) of the current reinforcement procedure. To address this, the BCBA should clearly redefine the intervention goal in observable and measurable terms (H1), explicitly including appropriate hand-raising criteria, and adjust reinforcement accordingly. Option A ignores the unwanted side effect and does not adequately address the intervention's limited effectiveness.
