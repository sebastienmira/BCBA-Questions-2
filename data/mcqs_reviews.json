    "question": "A BCBA is supervising a team of therapists working with children with autism. During a performance review, one therapist consistently demonstrates difficulty in implementing behavior intervention plans (BIPs) effectively. The BCBA decides to conduct a performance diagnostic to identify the underlying issues. After observing the therapist's sessions, the BCBA notes that the therapist often fails to reinforce desired behaviors consistently and misidentifies the function of challenging behaviors. Which of the following actions should the BCBA prioritize to address the therapist's performance issues while ensuring that the intervention is grounded in behaviorism and the principles of applied behavior analysis?",

    "question": "A BCBA is consulting at a school and observes a student, Liam, who frequently engages in off-task behaviors (e.g., staring out the window, doodling) during independent math assignments. The BCBA hypothesizes that Liam's off-task behaviors are maintained by automatic reinforcement, as they occur consistently regardless of teacher attention or peer interactions. To accurately measure Liam's off-task behavior, the BCBA designs a discontinuous measurement procedure. She selects momentary time sampling with 1-minute intervals during 20-minute math sessions. After two weeks, the data indicate that Liam is off-task during approximately 65% of sampled intervals. Liam's teacher argues that the data underestimate the true occurrence of off-task behaviors because Liam often returns to task briefly when the timer beeps. Considering radical behaviorism and measurement principles, how should the BCBA respond to the teacher's concern?",

      "Agree with the teacher and switch to partial interval recording, as it captures any occurrence of off-task behavior within intervals, aligning better with radical behaviorism's emphasis on observable events.",

    "rationale": "Momentary time sampling is a discontinuous measurement procedure that provides an unbiased estimate of behavior occurrence, especially for behaviors that occur at moderate to high rates. The teacher's concern that Liam briefly returns to task at the beep is valid, as momentary time sampling may underestimate behaviors that are brief or intermittent. However, radical behaviorism emphasizes observable and measurable events rather than internal states or inferred processes. Therefore, the BCBA should acknowledge the teacher's concern and suggest adjusting the interval length (e.g., shortening intervals) to increase accuracy. Option A (partial interval recording) would overestimate behavior occurrence, not providing an accurate representation. Option C incorrectly claims radical behaviorism prioritizes internal states, which it explicitly does not.

Parsimony is a fundamental philosophical assumption in behavior analysis, emphasizing the necessity to rule out simpler explanations or interventions before adopting more complex ones.

Additionally, ethical standards mandate that behavior analysts maintain competence by continually engaging in professional development activities and adhering to evidence-based practices. Failing to prioritize simpler, empirically supported interventions first violates both the philosophical assumption of parsimony and the ethical requirement to maintain professional competence through evidence-based decision-making. Options A, B, and D contain sophisticated misconceptions: determinism (A) involves the lawful and causal nature of behavior, pragmatism (B) emphasizes practical outcomes, and selectionism (D) pertains to the evolutionary selection of behavior based on consequences.

Functional analysis indicates aggression is maintained by escape from task demands. Due to limited staff resources, continuous measurement is impractical.

Given these constraints, what would be the most appropriate measurement procedure and accompanying intervention strategy to effectively monitor the behavior and minimize relapse risk?",

Partial interval recording is feasible and appropriate for behaviors that are discrete yet frequent enough to be reliably captured. Momentary time sampling (option B) may underestimate occurrences of short-duration aggression, and permanent product recording (option C) is inappropriate for behaviors that do not produce tangible, lasting outcomes. Latency recording (option D) measures time between stimulus and behavior onset, which is less relevant to the scenario described. Additionally, the intervention must mitigate relapse risk. Option A incorporates teaching an alternative replacement behavior (requesting breaks) and systematically fading reinforcement schedules from fixed-ratio to variable-ratio, which is known to produce greater resistance to extinction and reduce relapse. Option B's rapid fading and immediate extinction may increase relapse risk. Option C's DRL is inappropriate because aggression is harmful and any occurrence is undesirable.

    "question": "A BCBA is working with a 7-year-old child diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder who exhibits limited communication skills and difficulty engaging in play with peers. The BCBA conducts a functional behavior assessment (FBA) and identifies that the child often engages in echolalia during social interactions, which serves to escape from peer engagement. To address this, the BCBA decides to implement a trial-based procedure to teach the child appropriate play skills while simultaneously assessing the effectiveness of the intervention. Which of the following approaches best integrates the assessment of skill strengths and areas of need with the trial-based procedure to promote effective behavior change?",
    "options": [
      "Implement a discrete trial training (DTT) procedure to teach the child to request a turn in play, while using a preference assessment to identify toys that the child enjoys, ensuring that the child is motivated to engage with peers.",
      "Use a free-operant procedure where the child is allowed to choose any toy to play with, while observing the frequency of echolalic speech, and then provide reinforcement for any instance of spontaneous communication, regardless of context.",
      "Conduct a trial-based assessment where the child is prompted to engage in play with peers using scripted phrases, and then measure the duration of time spent in play without considering the quality of interactions or the child's enjoyment.",
      "Implement a naturalistic teaching strategy where the child is placed in a group setting with peers and is encouraged to use echolalic phrases as a means of communication, while collecting data on the number of peer interactions without modifying the child's behavior."

    "correct_answer": 0,
    "rationale": "Option A effectively integrates the assessment of the child's strengths (preference for certain toys) and areas of need (communication skills) by using a discrete trial training procedure that teaches functional communication (requesting a turn) in a motivating context. This aligns with the learning objectives of designing assessments that identify relevant skills and implementing trial-based procedures that promote behavior change. Option B, while incorporating a free-operant procedure, does not address the need for teaching specific communication skills. Option C focuses on scripted phrases without assessing the child's natural communication abilities or enjoyment, and Option D encourages echolalia without promoting functional communication, which does not support the child's development in social interactions.",

The analyst has collected baseline data showing that task refusal occurs in 80% of math sessions. After implementing a differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA) intervention, which involves reinforcing the client for requesting help appropriately, the frequency of task refusal decreases to 20% over a two-week period. However, the teacher reports that the client often requests help even when they are capable of completing the task independently.

She uses an A-B-A-B reversal design, collecting frequency data on disruptive behaviors daily. During the second baseline (withdrawal) phase, a substitute teacher unfamiliar with classroom routines replaces the regular teacher for two weeks. The graphed data show a clear decrease in disruptive behaviors during the first intervention phase, an increase during the second baseline, but the second intervention phase's data are highly variable and overlap substantially with the second baseline.

An extinction burst is a temporary increase in the frequency or intensity of the behavior when the reinforcement that previously maintained the behavior is no longer provided. Leila's increase in tantrums is a common response when access to a previously available reinforcer (her phone) is suddenly denied. Incorrect Answers: A. The procedure is not effective, and another strategy should be tried. The increase in tantrums is expected during an extinction burst and does not necessarily indicate that the procedure is ineffective. C. Leila's behavior is getting worse because she is now seeking attention in other ways. While she might seek attention in other ways, the primary reason for the initial increase is likely due to the extinction burst. D. The procedure is too restrictive and the phone should be limited after 9 P.M. instead of throughout the school year.

    "question": "A BCBA conducts an experiment to evaluate the effects of different schedules of reinforcement on a child's task completion behavior. Initially, she implements a multiple schedule design alternating between FR5 and FI 3-min schedules, each correlated with distinct colored cards. Subsequently, she introduces a chained schedule requiring the child to first complete tasks on an FR5 schedule (indicated by a blue card), immediately followed by an FI 3-min schedule (indicated by a yellow card), before reinforcement is delivered. Reviewing the graphed data, the BCBA notes clear stimulus control under the multiple schedule, but observes inconsistent responding and longer latency to initiate tasks under the chained schedule. Which of the following interpretations best explains these observed data patterns?",
    "options": [
      "The chained schedule weakened stimulus control because the discriminative stimuli in the second component functioned as conditioned reinforcers, making responding in the initial component less reinforcing and thus more variable.",
      "The chained schedule introduced ambiguity in stimulus control by combining two previously distinct discriminative stimuli, which disrupted the clear contingency established in the multiple schedule.",
      "The chained schedule increased response effort and delayed reinforcement delivery, reducing discriminative stimulus effectiveness and resulting in inconsistent responding and increased latency.",
      "The chained schedule inadvertently functioned as a concurrent schedule, allowing the child to allocate responding unevenly between schedule components and thus decreasing overall response consistency."

    "question": "A BCBA supervisor is mentoring a supervisee who is struggling to consistently implement a differential reinforcement procedure with fidelity. The supervisor decides to use a multiple baseline across behaviors design to systematically evaluate the supervisee's implementation fidelity after introducing three specific supervisory strategies: (1) executing a supervisor-supervisee contract clearly outlining expectations, (2) providing structured performance feedback sessions, and (3) modeling correct implementation procedures. After baseline data collection, the supervisor sequentially introduces each supervisory strategy across three target behaviors (correct prompting, accurate reinforcement delivery, and data collection). The data show that correct prompting improves immediately following the introduction of the supervisor-supervisee contract, accurate reinforcement delivery improves only after structured feedback sessions begin, and data collection accuracy improves only after modeling is provided.

Option A incorrectly assumes structured feedback alone improved all behaviors, which contradicts the data. Option B incorrectly generalizes the effectiveness of the contract across all behaviors, ignoring the specific, sequential improvements.

The BCBA notices that one RBT has been recording instances of the target behavior (aggression) inconsistently, sometimes counting occurrences based on the child's emotional state rather than a clear operational definition. The BCBA decides to revise the operational definition of aggression to ensure clarity and consistency among the team. After implementing this change, the BCBA reviews the data collected by the RBTs and finds that the new operational definition has led to a significant increase in reported instances of aggression. What should the BCBA do next to ensure effective supervision and data-based decision-making regarding the efficacy of the new operational definition?",
    "options": [
      "Conduct a team meeting to discuss the importance of the operational definition and provide additional training on data collection methods to ensure consistency across all RBTs.",
      "Analyze the data collected under the new operational definition to determine if the increase in reported instances of aggression is a true reflection of behavior change or an artifact of the new definition.",
      "Revise the operational definition again to reduce the number of instances counted as aggression, aiming to align it more closely with the RBT's previous understanding of the behavior.",
      "Implement a new intervention based on the increased data without further analysis, assuming that the increase indicates a need for more intensive behavior support."
    ],
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "rationale": "Option B is the correct answer because it emphasizes the importance of data analysis in making informed decisions about the efficacy of the new operational definition. The BCBA must determine whether the increase in reported instances of aggression is due to a genuine increase in the behavior or simply a result of the revised operational definition. This aligns with the learning objective of making data-based decisions about supervisory practices (I7). Option A, while beneficial for team cohesion and training, does not directly address the need for data analysis. Option C suggests a reactive approach that could lead to further confusion and inconsistency, while Option D disregards the need for careful analysis and could lead to inappropriate interventions. Thus, B is the most comprehensive and appropriate response, integrating both measurement and personnel management principles.",

Momentary time sampling can either underestimate or overestimate behavior rates, but it generally provides a more balanced estimate than partial interval recording. It records whether the behavior is occurring at the specific moment the interval ends. B. Whole Interval Recording. Whole interval recording tends to underestimate the rate of a behavior because it only records the behavior if it occurs for the entire duration of the interval. Short or infrequent behaviors might be missed entirely. D. Planned Activity Check. Planned activity check (PLACHECK) is a type of momentary time sampling used to observe group behavior.

    "question": "A BCBA is supervising a newly hired RBT who struggles with accurately implementing a token economy system designed to increase on-task behavior in a classroom setting. The RBT often forgets to deliver tokens immediately after the targeted behavior, leading to reduced effectiveness of the intervention. To address this, the BCBA decides to apply a function-based approach to assess and improve the RBT's performance. After conducting a performance diagnostic assessment, the BCBA identifies that the RBT's behavior is maintained by a lack of immediate feedback and unclear expectations. The BCBA then implements a plan involving a checklist for token delivery, immediate feedback after each session, and a weekly review meeting to reinforce correct implementation. After four weeks, the RBT consistently delivers tokens correctly, and the BCBA reduces the frequency of feedback sessions. Which of the following best illustrates the concept of response maintenance in this context?",

This indicates that the behavior change has been maintained over time without the need for constant supervision, aligning with the concept of response maintenance. Option B describes a strategy used to aid the RBT in remembering the task, not maintenance. Option C refers to the initial change in behavior due to feedback, not its maintenance. Option D involves ongoing reinforcement rather than demonstrating maintenance of behavior in the absence of such reinforcement.",

    "question": "A researcher conducts a single-case experimental design to evaluate the effectiveness of a new intervention aimed at reducing the duration of tantrums in children with autism. The researcher collects data on the duration of tantrums across three phases: baseline, intervention, and follow-up. During the baseline phase, the average duration of tantrums is 8 minutes, during the intervention phase, the average duration decreases to 3 minutes, and during the follow-up phase, it increases to 7 minutes. The researcher also measures the latency of tantrums, noting that the average latency during the intervention phase is 2 minutes compared to 5 minutes during baseline. Based on this data, which of the following conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of the intervention?",

      "The intervention was effective in reducing the duration of tantrums, as evidenced by the significant decrease during the intervention phase compared to baseline.",

    "question": "During a functional behavior assessment, a BCBA observes a 10-year-old child named Alex in a classroom setting. Alex frequently interrupts the teacher by shouting out answers without raising his hand, which results in the teacher often stopping the lesson to address Alex directly. The BCBA hypothesizes that Alex's behavior is maintained by social attention from the teacher. To confirm this hypothesis, the BCBA designs an intervention where Alex receives a token (which can be exchanged for extra recess time) each time he raises his hand and waits to be called on before speaking. After three weeks, data shows a significant decrease in shouting out and an increase in hand-raising. However, during a follow-up assessment, the BCBA notices that Alex's hand-raising behavior decreases when the token system is temporarily withdrawn. \n\nWhich of the following best describes the reinforcement contingencies at play and the implications for Alex's skill development?",
    "options": [
      "The initial intervention used positive reinforcement to increase Alex's hand-raising behavior, but the decrease during the withdrawal indicates that the behavior was not truly learned, suggesting a need for further skill development.",

      "The use of tokens as positive reinforcement successfully increased the desired behavior, but the reliance on the token system indicates that the skill has not generalized, suggesting a need to fade the tokens gradually.",
      "The intervention is an example of negative reinforcement because the removal of the token system led to a decrease in hand-raising, indicating that the tokens were functioning as an aversive stimulus."

    "correct_answer": 2,
    "rationale": "The scenario involves designing and evaluating an assessment of Alex's skill strengths and areas of need (F3) and distinguishing reinforcement contingencies (B4). The intervention applied positive reinforcement by using tokens to increase hand-raising. The decrease in behavior during the withdrawal of the tokens suggests that Alex's hand-raising behavior is dependent on the token reinforcement, indicating a lack of generalization. This implies that while the skill was initially learned, it has not been maintained without the external reinforcement, highlighting the need to gradually fade the tokens to promote generalization and ensure the skill is retained in the absence of the token system.
