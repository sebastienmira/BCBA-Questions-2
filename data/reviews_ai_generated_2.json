  "{\n    \"rating\": 5,\n    \"justification\": \"The question is clear, relevant, and aligns well with the ethical and legal standards in behavior analysis. The correct answer is unambiguous and directly addresses a fundamental requirement for delivering behavior-analytic services. The distractors are clearly incorrect and do not mislead the test-taker. The question fits well within the specified domain and subdomain, and the difficulty level is appropriate for the intended audience. Overall, it meets BCBA certification standards without any need for changes.\"\n}",
  "{\n    \"rating\": 5,\n    \"justification\": \"The question is clear, concise, and directly addresses the primary purpose of the BACB ethics codes. The options provided are relevant and appropriately distract from the correct answer without being misleading. The correct answer aligns well with the domain and subdomain, and the difficulty level is suitable for the intended audience. There are no ethical concerns or redundancies present, making this question an excellent fit for the BCBA certification standards.\"\n}",
  "{\n    \"rating\": 4,\n    \"justification\": \"The question is mostly strong and aligns well with ABA principles, specifically in the context of behavior-change procedures. The options provided are relevant and appropriate for the scenario described. However, the rationale could be slightly more detailed in explaining why DRA is preferred over the other options, particularly in terms of how it specifically addresses the out-of-seat behavior. Additionally, the question could benefit from a clearer distinction between the options to avoid any potential confusion among test-takers. Overall, it meets BCBA certification standards with minor refinements needed.\"\n}",
  "{\n    \"rating\": 4,\n    \"justification\": \"The question is well-structured and aligns with ABA principles, focusing on measurement and behavior analysis. The options provided are relevant and reflect different perspectives on the measurement procedure. However, the rationale could be clearer in addressing the teacher's concern about momentary time sampling and its implications for behavior measurement. Additionally, while the distractors are plausible, option D could be seen as misleading since whole interval recording is not appropriate for brief behaviors, which could confuse test-takers. Overall, it is a strong question but could benefit from minor refinements for clarity and precision.\"\n}",
  "{\n    \"rating\": 4,\n    \"justification\": \"The question is well-structured and aligns with ABA principles, particularly in emphasizing the importance of cultural sensitivity in assessments. The correct answer (Option B) is appropriate and reflects a nuanced understanding of the need to adapt assessments to cultural contexts. However, Option A could be seen as a distractor, but it is not as misleading as it could be. The question could be improved by clarifying the phrasing of the options to ensure they are equally plausible and by ensuring that the distractors do not contain any misleading implications about the assessment process. Overall, it is a strong question with minor refinements needed.\"\n}",
  "{\n    \"rating\": 4,\n    \"justification\": \"The question is well-structured and aligns with the BCBA certification standards, effectively integrating philosophical assumptions and ethical guidelines. The options provided are relevant and challenge the test-taker's understanding of key concepts in behavior analysis. However, there is a slight redundancy in the phrasing of the options that could lead to confusion, particularly in distinguishing between the philosophical concepts. Minor refinements in clarity and specificity could enhance the overall quality of the question.\"\n}",
  "{\n    \"rating\": 5,\n    \"justification\": \"The question is well-structured and aligns with effective personnel supervision and management practices in the context of ABA. The options provided are relevant and do not contain obvious distractors, allowing for critical analysis. The correct answer promotes collaboration and professional development, which is essential in supervision. The difficulty level is appropriate for the target audience, and the Bloom Taxonomy level of 'Analyze' is accurately reflected in the question's requirements. Overall, the question meets BCBA certification standards without any need for changes.\"\n}",
  "{\n    \"rating\": 4,\n    \"justification\": \"The question is well-structured and aligns with ABA principles, specifically regarding single-case experimental designs. The options provided are relevant and reflect different interpretations of the data. However, option D could be seen as a distractor since it suggests a design change that is unnecessary given the context. Additionally, the phrasing of the question could be slightly refined for clarity. Overall, it is a strong question with minor areas for improvement.\"\n}",
  "{\n    \"rating\": 5,\n    \"justification\": \"The question is well-structured and aligns with ABA principles, specifically focusing on measurement procedures relevant to the scenario presented.
